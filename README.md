[ This documentation was checked by Ducku ]

**Ducku** is a documentation analysis and code quality CLI tool designed to help developers maintain clean, consistent, and up-to-date codebases. It automatically scans projects to identify issues like outdated documentation references, unused modules, and inconsistencies between code and documentation.

## üöÄ Use Cases

### 1. Pattern Search üîç

Often documentation contains some outdated artifacts, like non-existing scripts and ports which have been changed.
Docku staticly detects certain patterns in documentation and checks their existance in the code.
Currently it supports:

- Filenames
- File paths (both Unix and Windows)
- Environment variables
- Ports


### 2. Partial Match Detection üéØ

Second frequent issue in documentation is partial lists. For example in this project there can be implemented a new use case, but it can be forgotten to document here.
So Ducku corresponds lists in documentation as
- headers
- bullet points

with potential lists in code as
- files/folders in one folder
- JSON/YAML keys/values at the same level

### 3. Unused Module Detection (beta)

This use case helps you to identify modules which are not imported from anywhere. 
That means one of:
- This module is an entry point (e.g CLI script or Docker endpoint)
- This module is obsolete

In the first case it should be documented, since it's direct instructions of using the system
In the second case likely deleted.

Languages support:

- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- C#
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP


## Installation üì¶

### Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install ducku
```

Then `ducku` binary will be available globally

### Using in CI/CD

Example of usage in CI/CD (GitLab):

```yaml
deploy:
    image: yarax/ducku:latest
    stage: deploy
    variables:
        PROJECT_PATH: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR"
    script:
        - ducku
```

Also feel free to utilize `Dockerfile` to build and use your own image.

## Usage üöÄ

### Command Line Interface

#### Analyze a Single Project
```bash
# Interactive mode
ducku

# Or specify project path
PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/your/project ducku
```

#### Analyze Multiple Projects
```bash
MULTI_FOLDER=/path/to/projects/directory ducku
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.ducku.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
# Disable specific use cases
disabled_use_cases:
# possible values
  - unused_modules
  - pattern_search
  - partial_lists

# Additional documentation paths
documentation_paths:
  - /tmp/other_docs

# Custom file patterns to skip
disabled_pattern_search_patterns:
# possible values
  - "Unix path"
  - "Windows path"
  - "Filename"
  - "TCP port"
  - "Environment variable"
```
